# Design-and-implementation-of-specific-video-object-fuzzy-system-based-on-deep-tracking
This project focuses on the development and implementation of an advanced video object fuzzy system that leverages state-of-the-art object tracking and detection techniques. The primary objective is to enhance privacy and focus by selectively applying blur to specific class objects, such as persons, dogs, and cats, in a video stream.
